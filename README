A slideshow of pictures w/ audio

`make` will:
  - generate a `dist/data.json` of all `pics/*` and `songs/*`
  - copy over play.html -> dist/index.html
  - copy all other assets (css, json, songs, pics, favicon) to dist/

Stand it up however you want, I like something like:
  - python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  - or https://github.com/svrxjs/svrx
